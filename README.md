# Car Dealership Database Scripts  

This is a simple SQL codebase designed to help developers manage a car dealership database. The scripts provide functionality to:  

1. **Populate tables**: Create and insert data into key tables, including dealerships, customers, vehicles, and contracts.  
2. **Query the database**: Perform queries to retrieve meaningful information from the data, such as customer details, vehicle inventory, and sales contracts.  
3. **Drop and repopulate tables**: Safely reset the database by dropping existing tables and recreating them to avoid duplicate entries.  

This code is structured for ease of use and serves as a great example of SQL database management for a car dealership system.
